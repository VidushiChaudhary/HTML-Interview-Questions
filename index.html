    h2 – Subheadings:<br>

    - If the content has further subsections, use h3 to create a logical flow.<br><br>

    h3 to h6 – Smaller Headings:<br>
    - These heading levels are used for finer subdivisions, gradually decreasing in size and importance.<br>
    - h3 is used for subsections under h2, while h4 to h6 are used for additional, less important subdivisions.<br>
    - h6 defines the least important heading.<br><br>
    <!---Use H2 for primary headings: H2 tags are often used for primary headings within a piece of content.
